## Project



* [Machine Learning]

  * Title: [Machine learning for crystallography](https://github.com/ng-git/OptiMol)
  * Built open-source `Python package` to predict the crystallographic structure of organic small molecules

- [Data Analysis]

Title: [Peak Prediction Hedging](https://github.com/chengweilin114/direct_capstone2020)
**Use random forest algorithms to analyze the top n highest peak datasets for customers,
rewarded about $100/kW for each unit of load reduced during the five highest hour-long peaks in the year of the total grid
**Applied `Pandas in Python` to built-up visual statistic for displaying the performance in each season

- [Data Visualization]
