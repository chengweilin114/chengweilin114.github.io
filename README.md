## Project

### Machine Learning

  * Title: [Machine learning for crystallography](https://github.com/ng-git/OptiMol)
  * Built open-source `Python package` to predict the crystallographic structure of organic small molecules

### Data Analysis

  * Title: [Peak Prediction Hedging](https://github.com/chengweilin114/direct_capstone2020)
  * Use random forest algorithms to analyze the top n highest peak datasets for customers, rewarded about $100/kW for each unit of load reduced during the     five highest hour-long peaks in the year of the total grid
  * Applied `Pandas in Python` to built-up visual statistic for displaying the performance in each season

### Data Visualization

  * Title:[Project management for visualization, analytics software development](https://github.com/chengweilin114/Updated_COVID-19_dashboard)
  * Implement web data connector skills to gain the updated daily COVID-19 datasets from data source and analyze the insights of data using Tableau to forecast the trend of Top5 infected State's total confirmed cases after one month 
  * Agile based planning and development of dynamic COVID-19 dashboard and data storyboarding in Tableau with Github based continuous deployment
